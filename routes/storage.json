They are proficient with modern tools (Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, Kafka) and languages (Python, Go, Rust, C++). An 'Advanced Intermediate' quiz level is chosen to push beyond their already strong practical application and assess their deeper theoretical understanding, architectural thinking, and ability to solve complex, novel problems for a Backend Engineer role. The selected topics specifically aim to: \\n\\n1. **System Design**: Evaluate their ability to architect scalable, reliable, and performant systems from first principles, considering trade-offs beyond what they've already implemented.\\n2. **Advanced DSA**: Ensure strong foundational problem-solving skills critical for optimizing backend logic.\\n3. **Distributed Systems Deep Dive**: Test a deeper understanding of the underlying principles (e.g., CAP theorem, consistency models, fault tolerance) of the distributed systems they've worked with.\\n4. **Database Internals & Advanced Optimization**: Assess their knowledge of how databases work under the hood, crucial for designing efficient data storage and retrieval systems.\\n5. **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Probe their understanding of complex concurrency issues and patterns, essential for high-performance backend services, building upon their 'Ayumi' project experience.\\n6. **Kubernetes Networking & Troubleshooting**: Move beyond basic usage to assess their grasp of advanced Kubernetes concepts and common operational challenges.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that the assessment bridges the gap between their impressive practical skills and the comprehensive theoretical and design knowledge required for impactful contributions in a modern software engineering role.\"\n}\n```"
