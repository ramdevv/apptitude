However, for a production-ready Junior Python Backend Developer role, there are critical areas requiring deeper understanding. The chosen intermediate topics aim to bridge these gaps: moving beyond NoSQL to mastering relational databases with SQL and ORMs, understanding cloud deployment beyond local Docker, implementing robust testing (unit, integration, mocking) as a standard practice, and securing APIs effectively. Furthermore, introducing `asyncio` for performance and caching with Redis are crucial for scalable backend services. Basic CI/CD concepts will prepare them for modern deployment pipelines, ensuring a more holistic understanding of backend development for a production environment."\n}',
